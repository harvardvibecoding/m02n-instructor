## IP Strategy & Competitive Analysis

### Freedom to Operate (FTO) Assessment

Example AI has conducted FTO analyses for its core product areas:

| Product Area | FTO Status | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| LLM Gateway | Clear | No blocking patents identified |
| Fine-Tuning | Clear | Standard ML techniques; no novel claims |
| RAG Pipeline | Clear | Builds on prior art (HuggingFace, etc.) |
| Cost Optimization | Clear | Novel approach, proprietary implementation |

### Competitive Patent Landscape

| Competitor | Est. Patents | Overlap Risk |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| LangChain | <5 | Low (OSS focus) |
| Humanloop | <10 | Low |
| OpenAI | 50+ | Medium (broad claims) |
| Google | 200+ | Low (different focus) |
| Microsoft | 150+ | Low (different focus) |

**Assessment:** No identified patent infringement risks. OpenAI has broad patents but primarily focused on model architecture, not orchestration/infrastructure.
