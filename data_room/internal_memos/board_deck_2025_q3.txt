   - Close 6 enterprise/mid-market deals ($420K pipeline)
   - Expand 6 existing customers ($180K expansion target)
   - Maintain churn <5%

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RISKS & MITIGATIONS

1. Growth Acceleration Risk
   Risk: May not hit $3.5M+ ARR needed for strong Series B
   Mitigation: Conservative target ($3.25M), partnerships de-risking growth,
               expansion focus driving NRR

2. Customer Concentration Persistent
   Risk: Top 10 still = 78% of ARR
   Mitigation: New logo acquisition through partnerships, mid-market focus

3. Macro Environment Headwinds
   Risk: Enterprise AI budgets under scrutiny
   Mitigation: ROI-focused selling, cost optimization messaging,
               partnerships reduce friction

4. Small Team Execution Risk
   Risk: 34 FTE to execute on ambitious plan
   Mitigation: Focused roadmap, partnerships leverage external resources,
               leadership team experienced

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLOSING REMARKS - RESILIENCE & RECOVERY

Q2 2025 was the most challenging quarter in our company's history.
We faced a financial crisis driven by revenue recognition errors,
customer concentration, and over-hiring.

Q3 2025 shows we made the right decisions:
✓ Restructuring executed professionally
✓ Burn reduced 54%
✓ Runway extended to 19 months
✓ Customer health stabilizing
✓ Team morale recovering
✓ Path to Series B viable

We are not out of the woods yet. We need to accelerate growth in Q4/Q1
to position for a strong Series B. But we have the team, product, and
financial discipline to get there.

Thank you to the board for your support during this difficult period.
