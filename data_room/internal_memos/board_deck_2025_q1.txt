RISKS & MITIGATIONS

1. Competitive Intensity from Cloud Providers
   Risk: AWS/Azure/GCP bundling LLM orchestration
   Mitigation: Multi-cloud value prop, partnerships with cloud providers,
               enterprise moat (compliance, support)

2. Sales Hiring Velocity
   Risk: Behind on AE hiring (6 vs 8 target)
   Mitigation: Recruiter hire, VP Marketing to strengthen brand/inbound

3. International Expansion Slow
   Risk: Only 14% international revenue (target was 20%)
   Mitigation: Evaluating EMEA AE hire in H2, marketplace expansion

4. Platform Scaling to 1B+ Requests
   Risk: Infrastructure strain at 10x current volume
   Mitigation: VP Eng focus, multi-region, reserved capacity, auto-scaling

5. Customer Concentration
   Risk: Top 10 customers = 54% of ARR (improving but still high)
   Mitigation: Continued new logo acquisition, mid-market expansion

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
