   - On-prem deployment (pilot with 2 prospects)
   - Cost analytics dashboard

4. SCALE TEAM STRATEGICALLY
   - Post-funding: hire VP Eng, 3 senior engineers, 2 AEs

5. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
   - Implement SOC2 Type 1 compliance (required for enterprise)
   - Reduce P95 latency to <500ms
   - Maintain 99.9% uptime SLA

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RISKS & MITIGATIONS

Risk: Series A doesn't close by June
→ Mitigation: Maintain parallel conversations with 5+ firms;
              prepared to extend runway via bridge round from existing investors

Risk: OpenAI/Anthropic launch competing orchestration layer
→ Mitigation: Focus on enterprise differentiation (security, SLAs, multi-provider);
              explore strategic partnership with one major provider

Risk: Top customer concentration (top 5 = 52% of ARR)
→ Mitigation: Aggressive new customer acquisition; expansion in mid-market segment

Risk: GPU cost volatility
→ Mitigation: Negotiating annual contracts with compute providers;
              passing through cost increases via pricing tiers
