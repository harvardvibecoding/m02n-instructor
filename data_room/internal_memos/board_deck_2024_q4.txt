2024 FULL YEAR RETROSPECTIVE

What Went Well:
✓ Exceeded ARR target ($2.48M vs $2.5M plan)
✓ Successfully closed Series A ($38M)
✓ Scaled team effectively (18 → 40 FTE)
✓ Shipped major product milestones (on-prem, agentic, multi-region)
✓ Zero regrettable attrition
✓ First Fortune 500 customer (GlobalBank)
✓ SOC2 Type 2 achieved
✓ Platform reliability exceeded SLAs

What Could Have Been Better:
⚠ Sales hiring took longer than expected (Q2-Q3 delays)
⚠ Latency optimization slower than planned (520ms vs 500ms target)
⚠ International expansion minimal (only 12% of customers)
⚠ Customer concentration still high (top 10 = 58% of ARR)
⚠ Burn rate higher than plan ($350K avg vs $300K target)

Key Learnings:
1. VP-level hires are transformative (Sarah, James immediate impact)
2. Enterprise sales cycles predictable with right process (MEDDIC)
3. Product-market fit strongest in regulated industries (finance, healthcare)
4. Partnerships take 2-3 quarters to ramp (patience required)
5. SOC2 is table stakes for enterprise (should have prioritized earlier)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RISKS & MITIGATIONS (2025)

1. Revenue Growth Execution Risk
   Risk: 4x growth is aggressive, may miss targets
   Mitigation: Strong pipeline coverage (4.5x), VP Sales driving discipline,
               diversified customer acquisition (enterprise + PLG)

2. Competitive Intensity
   Risk: OpenAI/Anthropic, cloud providers intensifying competition
   Mitigation: Enterprise moat (security, compliance, SLAs), multi-provider value,
               vertical solutions differentiation

3. Hiring at Scale
   Risk: Doubling headcount (40 → 78) while maintaining quality
   Mitigation: Hiring experienced leaders (CFO, VP Product, Head of CS),
               recruiter hire, strong employer brand

4. Customer Concentration
   Risk: Top 10 = 58% of ARR
   Mitigation: Aggressive new logo acquisition (targeting 260 customers EOY),
               expansion in mid-market segment

5. Platform Scaling
   Risk: 10x request volume could strain infrastructure
   Mitigation: VP Eng focused on scaling, reserved capacity, multi-region redundancy

6. International Expansion
   Risk: Limited presence outside US (88% of revenue)
   Mitigation: 2025 plan includes international go-to-market expansion (EMEA AE)
