Goal: Establish Example AI as enterprise standard for LLM infrastructure

Progress:
✓ On-prem deployment shipped (unlocking regulated industries)
✓ Multi-region support (EU/APAC data residency)
✓ Enterprise sales motion maturing (68 day cycles, 38% win rate)
✓ Reference customers in 4 verticals (fintech, healthcare, SaaS, e-commerce)

Challenges:
⚠ Sales hiring slower than planned (3 AEs vs 5 target)
⚠ Need more Fortune 500 logos (currently have 2)

Next Steps:
→ Close VP Sales hire (Oct target)
→ Hire 2 more AEs in Q4
→ Launch vertical-specific messaging (fintech, healthcare)

Goal: Drive efficient mid-market customer acquisition

Progress:
✓ Free tier converting at 9.2% (up from 8.1%)
✓ Self-serve onboarding flow redesigned (reduced drop-off 30%)
✓ In-product upgrade prompts driving conversions

Challenges:
⚠ Activation rate only 42% (users who run first API call)
⚠ Need better onboarding for non-technical users

Next Steps:
→ Implement activation playbook (email drip, in-app guidance)
→ Launch "templates library" for common use cases
→ Invest in docs & tutorials (hire DevRel)

3. International Expansion
──────────────────────────────────────
Progress:
✓ Multi-region deployment (EU, APAC) in beta
✓ 8 international customers signed (UK, Germany, Singapore)

4. Strategic Partnerships
──────────────────────────────────────
Progress:
✓ Streamline Commerce generating $215K ARR

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RISKS & MITIGATIONS

1. Sales Hiring Delays
   Risk: Can't hit Q4/2025 targets without more AEs
   Mitigation: VP Sales hire will accelerate recruiting; expanded sourcing

2. AWS Bedrock Competition
   Risk: Cloud providers bundling LLM orchestration for free
   Mitigation: Emphasize multi-cloud, vendor independence; partner with AWS

3. Customer Concentration
   Risk: Top 10 customers = 62% of ARR
   Mitigation: Aggressive new logo acquisition; expand mid-market

4. Platform Scaling
   Risk: Latency/reliability issues at 10x scale
   Mitigation: VP Eng leading infra overhaul; reserved capacity deals

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ASKS OF THE BOARD

1. Approve Revised EOY Headcount Target
   - Revising from 45 to 42 FTE (more conservative hiring)
   - Rationale: Sales hiring market tougher than expected

2. Approve VP Sales Compensation Package
   - Target comp: $250K base + OTE $500K + equity
   - Board approval required for executive hires

3. Guidance on International Expansion
   - Should we hire EMEA AE in Q1 2025 or wait?
   - Board perspective on international timing?
