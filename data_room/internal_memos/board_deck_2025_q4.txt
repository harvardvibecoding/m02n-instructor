2025 FULL YEAR RETROSPECTIVE

A Year of Extremes:
─────────────────────────────────────────
Q1: Strong growth (thought we had $3.72M ARR)
Q2: Crisis (discovered revenue recognition errors, $1.8M actual ARR)
Q3: Restructuring (48 → 34 FTE, burn cut 54%)
Q4: Recovery (ARR $2.78M, NRR 112%, path to Series B)

What We Learned:
1. Financial controls are not optional (CFO hire should have been earlier)
2. Customer concentration is an existential risk (diversify constantly)
3. Partnerships are the most efficient growth channel (62% lower CAC)
4. Transparency with board & investors builds trust (crisis communication)
5. Team resilience is everything (survived layoffs, stayed focused)

What Went Well:
✓ Survived existential crisis
✓ Demonstrated financial discipline
✓ Retained key customers & employees
✓ Built strong partnerships (Snowflake, AWS, AMD)
✓ Improved unit economics (7.2x LTV/CAC)
✓ Positioned for Series B from strength

What Could Have Been Better:
⚠ Should have hired CFO 12 months earlier
⚠ Should have diversified customers earlier
⚠ Should have focused on partnerships from day 1
⚠ Over-hired in Q1 based on inflated metrics
⚠ GPU lease commitments too aggressive

Key Takeaway:
We are a stronger company today than we were 12 months ago.
The crisis forced discipline, focus, and operational excellence.
