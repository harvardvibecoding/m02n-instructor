FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - Q2 REALITY CHECK

Revenue Metrics (as of June 1, 2025)
─────────────────────────────────────────
ARR:                           $1,800,000
MRR:                           $150,000
QoQ Growth:                    -52% (contraction)
YoY Growth:                    60%

Q2 ARR Movement Analysis:
Starting ARR (April 1):        $3,720,000
New Bookings:                  $285,000
Expansion:                     $95,000
Churn:                         -$2,128,000 (crisis)
Contraction:                   -$172,000
Ending ARR (June 30):          $1,800,000

What Happened - The Full Story:
─────────────────────────────────────────
MAJOR CHURN EVENT:
GlobalBank Corp (our largest customer: $245K ARR)
→ Did not churn, but paused expansion and reduced to $60K ARR
→ Reason: Internal AI initiative budget frozen company-wide
→ Contract restructured to smaller scope

TOP 10 CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION CRISIS:
When we audited revenue recognition practices in April (new CFO),
we discovered significant issues:

1. Revenue Recognition Errors:
   - Several enterprise contracts had been recognized upfront
   - Should have been recognized ratably over contract term
   - CFO Michael Chen identified $1.92M in overstated ARR from Q1

2. Actual Q1 ARR was ~$1.8M, not $3.72M
   - Booked revenue ≠ Recognized revenue
   - Poor financial controls from pre-CFO era
   - Board was reporting inflated numbers unintentionally

3. Customer Concentration Reality:
   - Top 5 customers = 78% of actual ARR
   - GlobalBank reduction had outsized impact
   - Lost 2 other customers due to budget cuts ($128K combined)

Cash Position - URGENT
─────────────────────────────────────
Starting Cash (April 1):      $34.4M
Current Cash (June 1):         $31.8M
Q2 Burn:                       $2.6M ($867K/mo)
Runway:                        6.0 months (conservative forecast)

Q2 Burn Analysis (elevated):
- Personnel (48 FTE):          $420K/mo
- Cloud/GPU Infrastructure:    $265K/mo (committed contracts)
- Sales & Marketing:           $115K/mo
- Other:                       $67K/mo

Why Burn Elevated:
- Revenue did not scale as expected (lower offset)
- GPU lease commitments locked in ($2.4M annual, can't exit easily)
- Headcount at 48 (hired based on inflated growth expectations)

Cash Flow Projection (Current Trajectory):
Q3 2025:                       -$2.4M
Q4 2025:                       -$2.0M
Cash Depletion:                December 2025 (without action)

Customer Metrics (Corrected):
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total Customers:               68 (down from 152 after audit)
Enterprise (>$50K ARR):        8 (down from 38)
Mid-Market ($10K-50K):         22
SMB (<$10K):                   38
Net Dollar Retention:          48% (crisis level)
Gross Dollar Retention:        82%
Avg Contract Value:            $26,500

Note on Customer Count Correction:
- Q1 count of 152 included free tier users incorrectly
- Actual paying customers: 68
- Another financial controls gap identified by CFO

ARR by Segment (Actual):
Enterprise (>$50K):            $680K (38%)
Mid-Market:                    $650K (36%)
SMB:                           $470K (26%)

Top Customers (June 2025):
1. Titan Insurance             $245K (only Fortune 500 remaining)
2. MediCore Health             $180K
3. Apex Financial              $152K
4. StreamVault Tech            $128K
5. Vertex Systems              $125K
6. DataFlow Systems            $105K (down from $195K - contraction)
7. Helix Pharma               $98K
8. MicroSolutions              $87K
9. Quantum Dynamics            $78K (down from $168K - contraction)
10. GlobalBank Corp            $60K (down from $245K - major contraction)

Top 10 = 85% of ARR (extreme concentration)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - WHAT WENT WRONG

1. Financial Controls & Reporting Failure
─────────────────────────────────────────
Issue: Revenue recognition practices were incorrect
- Booked revenue reported as ARR (should be recognized revenue)
- No finance function until CFO hired in Feb 2025
- Founders + early team didn't understand ASC 606 compliance

Impact:
- Q1 ARR overstated by $1.92M (actual: $1.8M, reported: $3.72M)
- Customer count overstated (152 reported, 68 actual paying)
- Board and investors misled unintentionally
- Growth narrative was false

CFO Actions Taken:
✓ Full revenue audit completed (April-May)
✓ Implemented proper rev rec system (NetSuite)
✓ Restated Q1 financials (painful but necessary)
✓ Installed financial controls & monthly close process

Learning: Should have hired CFO 12 months earlier

2. Customer Concentration Risk Realized
─────────────────────────────────────────
Issue: Top 10 customers = 85% of ARR (extreme)
- GlobalBank reduction ($245K → $60K) had massive impact
- When top customers churn/contract, company is vulnerable
- Did not diversify customer base fast enough

Impact:
- Single customer change wiped out growth
- NRR crashed to 48%
- Investor confidence at risk

Mitigation Plan:
→ Aggressive new logo acquisition (mid-market focus)
→ Reduce top 10 concentration to <60% by EOY
→ Diversify across industries & use cases

3. GPU Hardware Lease Commitments
─────────────────────────────────────────
Issue: Locked into $2.4M annual GPU lease contracts
- Signed in Q4 2024 based on growth projections
- Cannot exit without penalties
- Revenue didn't materialize, stuck with costs

Impact:
- Burn rate elevated by $200K/mo
- Fixed costs with variable revenue = bad unit economics

Actions:
→ Negotiating with AMD to restructure lease (in progress)
→ Exploring sublease options
→ Shift to consumption-based pricing where possible

4. Sales Execution Challenges
─────────────────────────────────────────
Issue: Sales team underperformed in Q2
- Only $285K new bookings vs $1.2M+ target
- 3 large deals slipped to Q3 ($420K pipeline)
- Sales cycle lengthened (72 days avg vs 58 in Q1)

Contributing Factors:
- Macro headwinds (enterprise AI budget scrutiny)
- Competitive pressure (AWS Bedrock, OpenAI)
- Product gaps for certain use cases

Actions:
→ VP Sales James Park restructuring sales approach
→ Focus on faster-closing mid-market deals
→ Improve sales enablement & training

- VP Sales: James Park
- VP Marketing: Sarah Rodriguez
- VP Product: David Kim

Workforce Planning - Tough Decisions
──────────────────────────────────────
Current Situation:
- 48 FTE with $1.8M ARR = unsustainable burn
- Need to reduce to ~32-35 FTE for runway extension
- Evaluating 13-15 person reduction (layoff)

Timeline:
- Board approval required for layoff plan
- Target execution: July (if approved)
- Estimated savings: $180K/mo reduction in personnel costs

Retention Priorities (If Layoff Approved):
1. Engineering: Core platform team (reduce from 28 to 20)
2. Sales: Top performers only (reduce from 6 AEs to 4)
3. Product: Retain VP + 2 PMs (reduce from 4 to 3)
4. CS: Retain both CSMs (critical for retention)
5. Marketing: VP + 2 core team (reduce from 7 to 3)

Attrition & Morale
──────────────────────────────────────
Q2 Attrition:                  2 voluntary departures
Retention Rate:                96% (still strong)
eNPS:                          7.2/10 (declining)
Engagement Score:              76% (down from 88%)

Morale Impact:
- Team aware of challenges (transparent communication)
- Some anxiety about potential layoffs
- Leadership being candid with team

Actions to Support Team:
→ Weekly all-hands with Q&A (transparency)
→ 1:1s with leadership for concerned employees
→ Clear communication about path forward once decided

Operational Changes (Cost Reduction)
──────────────────────────────────────
Actions Taken (May-June):
✓ Paused NYC office expansion (saving $8K/mo)
✓ Renegotiated SaaS contracts (saving $12K/mo)
✓ Reduced travel & events budget (saving $15K/mo)
✓ Paused non-essential vendors (saving $18K/mo)

In Progress:
→ GPU lease renegotiation with AMD (target: $80K/mo savings)
→ Cloud infrastructure optimization (target: $40K/mo savings)
→ Office space sublease exploration (SF HQ)

CFO Leading Cost Reduction Workstream:
Target: Reduce monthly burn from $867K to $450K by August

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STRATEGIC OPTIONS - BOARD DECISION REQUIRED

We face a critical decision point. Three primary options:

OPTION 1: EXTEND RUNWAY + RESTRUCTURE
─────────────────────────────────────────
Actions:
• Implement workforce reduction (13-15 people)
• Renegotiate GPU leases (AMD discussions ongoing)
• Reduce burn to $450K/mo (from $867K/mo)
• Focus on core customers & expansion revenue
• Delay Series B to Q2 2026 (when metrics improve)

Projected Outcome:
• Runway extends to 18+ months
• ARR growth modest ($2.5-3M by EOY 2025)
• Smaller team focused on efficiency
• Series B possible in 2026 if execution improves

Pros:
+ Extends runway without external capital
+ Demonstrates financial discipline to future investors
+ Allows time to rebuild metrics
+ Avoids down round

Cons:
- Layoffs damage morale
- Slower growth trajectory
- Competitive risk (competitors gaining ground)
- Uncertainty with team & customers

OPTION 2: RAISE BRIDGE ROUND NOW
─────────────────────────────────────────
Actions:
• Raise $5-8M bridge from existing investors (Stellar, Aurora, etc.)
• Use bridge to extend runway 12 months
• Implement moderate cost reductions (no layoffs)
• Focus on sales execution & new logo acquisition
• Raise Series B in Q4 2025 from position of stability

Projected Outcome:
• Runway through Q2 2026
• ARR growth to $4-5M by EOY 2025
• Maintain team & momentum
• Series B from better position

Pros:
+ Avoids layoffs
+ Maintains team morale
+ More time for sales execution
+ Can invest in growth

Cons:
- Dilution to existing shareholders
- Down round concerns (lower valuation)
- Bridge terms may be onerous (high interest, warrants)
- Still need Series B in 6-12 months

OPTION 3: ACCELERATE SERIES B NOW
─────────────────────────────────────────
Actions:
• Launch Series B fundraise immediately (July)
• Accept current metrics ($1.8M ARR, challenged growth)
• Target smaller raise ($30-40M vs $75-100M original plan)
• Accept lower valuation ($200-250M vs $500-600M)
• Focus on investors who understand the story

Projected Outcome:
• Raise $30-40M at lower valuation
• Runway through 2027
• Ability to invest in growth
• Significant dilution

Pros:
+ Solves cash problem definitively
+ Can invest in growth & sales
+ Demonstrates investor confidence
+ Avoids layoffs

Cons:
- Significant dilution (down round from $150M Series A)
- Difficult fundraising environment (current metrics weak)
- May not be able to raise at all
- Damages company narrative & founder morale

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION

Recommended Path: OPTION 1 (Extend Runway + Restructure)

Rationale:
1. We have the cash to extend runway ourselves (no external dependency)
2. Current metrics too weak for Series B (would be heavily dilutive down round)
3. Bridge round terms likely onerous given current position
4. Financial discipline demonstrates maturity to future investors
5. Gives us time to rebuild metrics & narrative

Proposed Action Plan:
─────────────────────────────────────────
Immediate (July 2025):
✓ Implement workforce reduction: 13 people (to 35 FTE)
  - Engineering: 28 → 20
  - Sales: 8 → 5 (VP + 4 AEs)
  - Marketing: 7 → 3 (VP + 2)
  - Product: 4 → 3
  - CS: 2 → 2 (retain both)
  - Ops: 2 → 2 (retain CFO team)

✓ Finalize GPU lease renegotiation (target: 50% reduction)
✓ Implement all cost reduction measures
✓ Target burn: $450K/mo (52% reduction)

Q3 2025:
→ Focus on existing customer expansion (drive NRR to 110%+)
→ Close 3 slipped enterprise deals ($420K pipeline)
→ Win 5 new mid-market customers ($250K ARR)
→ Target: $2.2M ARR by Sept 30

Q4 2025:
→ Continue new logo acquisition (efficient channels: partnerships)
→ Launch integration marketplace (ecosystem play)
→ Target: $2.8M ARR by Dec 31

2026 Plan:
→ Rebuild to 25-30% QoQ growth
→ NRR back to 120%+
→ Diversify customer base (reduce top 10 to <60%)
→ Raise Series B Q2 2026 at fair valuation ($250-300M)

Financial Impact of Recommended Plan:
─────────────────────────────────────────
Current State:
Burn: $867K/mo, Runway: 6 months

Post-Restructuring (August 2025):
Burn: $450K/mo, Runway: 18 months

ARR Targets:
Q3 2025: $2.2M
Q4 2025: $2.8M
Q2 2026: $5.0M (Series B raise timing)

Cost Structure Post-Restructuring:
Personnel (35 FTE):        $285K/mo
Infrastructure:            $125K/mo (post GPU renegotiation)
Sales & Marketing:         $28K/mo
Other:                     $12K/mo
Total:                     $450K/mo

With revenue scaling, burn reduces further:
Q3 2025: $420K/mo
Q4 2025: $380K/mo
Q1 2026: $350K/mo

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CUSTOMER RETENTION & EXPANSION PLAN

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BOARD ASKS - URGENT DECISIONS REQUIRED

1. **APPROVE RESTRUCTURING PLAN**
   - Workforce reduction: 48 FTE → 35 FTE (13 person layoff)
   - Severance budget: $520K (2 months per person + benefits)
   - Timeline: Execute July 2025

2. **APPROVE GPU LEASE RENEGOTIATION AUTHORITY**
   - Authorize CEO to restructure AMD lease
   - Target: 50% reduction ($120K/mo savings)
   - May require exit fees or extended term

3. **APPROVE REVISED 2025 PLAN**
   - Lower ARR target: $2.8M (from $10.2M)
   - Lower headcount: 35 FTE (from 78)
   - Lower burn: $450K/mo (from plan)
   - Delay Series B to Q2 2026

4. **GUIDANCE ON ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS**
   - If board prefers Option 2 (bridge) or Option 3 (Series B now),
     management needs clear direction
   - Bridge terms: What dilution/terms are acceptable?
   - Series B now: What valuation floor is acceptable?

5. **BOARD SUPPORT & INVOLVEMENT**
   - Introductions to bridge investors (if pursuing Option 2)
   - Help with customer retention (executive relationships)
   - Guidance on communication strategy

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLOSING REMARKS - DIFFICULT BUT NECESSARY

This is the hardest board deck we've presented. We made mistakes:
• Financial controls were insufficient
• Customer concentration risk was not managed
• We over-hired based on inflated metrics
• We locked into GPU commitments prematurely

However, we have strong assets:
✓ Exceptional product & technology
✓ World-class leadership team
✓ Loyal customer base (despite challenges)
✓ Strong partnerships (AWS, Snowflake, etc.)
✓ Enough cash to control our destiny

We believe the right path is to restructure, extend runway, rebuild metrics,
and raise Series B from a position of strength in 2026.

This will be painful in the short term, but it sets us up for long-term success.

We need the board's support and guidance to navigate this period.
